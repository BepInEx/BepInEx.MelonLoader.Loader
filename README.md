## BepInEx.MelonLoader.Loader

Loader for BepInEx to be able to use MelonLoader plugins.

IL2CPP only, as I am not aware of any games that are Mono-based and still use
MelonLoader

Right now this is the only way you can run MelonLoader mods/plugins on 32-bit games ðŸ¤ 

#### Notes

- TLS currently does not work
- modprefs.ini is now using the BepInEx TOML config system, and is located under `BepInEx/config/MelonLoader.cfg`
- The Mods and Plugins folders have been moved to `MelonLoader/Mods` and `MelonLoader/Plugins` folders respectively

### Installation instructions

1. Install the IL2CPP preview of BepInEx from here ([server](https://discord.gg/MpFEDAg) and [message](https://discord.com/channels/623153565053222947/754333645199900723/774723954258083860) (pick the correct bitness for your game).
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.MelonLoader.Loader/releases) into the `BepInEx/plugins` folder (create the folder if it doesn't exist)
3. (Optional but recommended) Download the dependencies for your game's unity version [here](https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader/tree/master/BaseLibs/UnityDependencies) (you can figure out the unity version by right clicking your game's .exe and checking the properties -> details -> file version)
     Extract them into your `BepInEx/unhollowed/base` folder (create it if it doesn't exist). If you've opened your game before this point, delete the `assembly-hash.txt` file in your `BepInEx/unhollowed` directory and it'll regenerate correctly.
